# Mastermind

This is my second year C programming project based on the game master mind. It will show my basic understanding of the C programming language.

### How to play
The game itself is played by two players normaly, in this instance it is against the computer. The aim of the game is to beat the mastermind.
The master mind chooses 4 colours and the player has to guess the right colours.
The player gets a certain number of attempts to get the combination right.

### Features

- The game has 3 modes easy, medium and hard.
- The main menu lets you choose the different modes and has an options screen to explain how to play.
- The player can enter how many times they want to attempt to guess the combination.
